By default make the section highlights of opacity 0

When I hover over a section highlight, make the opacity 1

use ease-in-out for the animation

The purple circle currently sits on top of the section highlights. Because of this the hover effect doesn't work

Make the purple section ignore pointer events so that the hover effect works
