Create a new component and import it into this page

Then in the imported component, do the following:

When i click anywhere on the screen, start a new instance of a "ðŸ”¥" emoji at that location.

Then animate it upwards for about 200 pixels with scaling and rotation

When it reaches 200 pixels up, fade it out and remove it from the DOM

Use framer motion for the animation

// ADDED LATER:

I don't see animatedReactions work

---

When the emoji instance is created the cursor becomes a text cursor

keep the same pointer cursor and do not highlight the emoji text

I want the layers under this div which triggers the emoji selectable. It should essentally be a transparent layer

I still can't select the text inside @page.tsx

now the layers are selectable but the emoji is not triggered
