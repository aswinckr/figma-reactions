By defualt PieShape component should be hidden with opacity 0

When I press on E, animate and scale the component to it's original size and make it visible with opacity 1

// ADDED LATER:

The center of origin pieshape component should be where the mouse cursor is

Once pieshape is visible after pressing E, keep it's position fixed where it was triggered

To it invisible again I have to click anywhere outside the component
