Add a circle at the center of the pieshape and make it purle in color, almost 1/3rd of the size of the pieshape.

In the middle of the circle add a Shuffle icon

When I click on Shuffle, I want all the emjois in the pieshape to be shuffled.

// ADDED LATER:

Briing the z index of the The suffle circle up and make it clickable. It currently interferes with the click area of the pie

Instead of the shuffle icon use the ðŸ”€ emoji
